## About
An exercise in taking a given design deck and translating it into HTML & Sass

## Tech Stack
Sass & HTML

## Development Process
- To build, I started with semantic HTML markup, keeping in mind accessibility web standards
- From there, I worked into Sass. Starting with key overarching styles, then adding more specific styling to target smaller elements
- In order to ensure the project was well organized, I utilized Sass partials: one partial for all variables, another for key setup styles (inc., fonts, wrappers, & broad styles), and a partial for media queries. From there, I added additional partials for each section of the site.
- Overall this project was a success! It was a great execution of new skills & Iâ€™m proud to have created a site that is true to the original design deck

## Lessons Learned
As this was my first project utilizing Sass, I challenged myself to use @mixins for key text elements that shared font styling but had different font sizes. Although, this is not necessarily the best use-case of mixins, I wanted to implement them in this project to get experience utilizing all features in Sass. After experimenting & learning this new-to-me syntax, I was able to execute it successfully.
