## About
An exercise in taking a given design deck and translating it into HTML & Sass

## Development Process
- To build, I started with semantic HTML markup, keeping in mind accessibility web standards
- From there, I worked into Sass. Starting with key overarching styles, then adding more specific styling to target smaller elements
- In order to ensure the project was well organized, I utilized Sass partials: one partial for all variables, another for key setup styles (inc. fonts, wrappers, & broad styles), and a partial for media queries. From there, I added additional partials for each section of the site.
- Overall this project was a success! It was a great execution of new skills & Iâ€™m proud to have created a site that is true to the original design deck

## Features
- As this was my first project utilizing Sass, I challenged myself to use @mixins for key text elements which shared font styling but had different font-sizes. Although, this is not necessarily the best use-case of mixins, I wanted to implement them in this project to get experience utilizing all features in Sass. I was able to execute successfully.

## Next Steps
- This is my first project with git implementation
- Git was used successfully, although at the time of developing, I was unaware of git-branching, so it was not utilized. Going forward, I will be using git-branching to improve workflow and to ensure updates are not pushed to main until all bugs have been worked through
